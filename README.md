## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learnt the idea behind using `* {box-sizing: border-box;}` in CSS styling. Furthermore, this challenge compelled me to learn Git and GitHub as well as Markdown, the lack of which had hindered my progress as a developer.

```css
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

I hope to come improve on the presentaion and funtionality of the QR-Code Component sometime as I improve my knowledge and skillbase.

### Useful resources

- [HTML CSS Tutorial Order Summary Component](https://www.freecodecamp.com) - This resource really helped me wrap my head around the CSS Box Model concept. I really liked this tutorial and will refer to it in subsequent projects.
- [Git & GitHub Crash Course](https://www.traversymedia.com) - Brad Traversy has always been an inspiration to me and many newbie developers. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
